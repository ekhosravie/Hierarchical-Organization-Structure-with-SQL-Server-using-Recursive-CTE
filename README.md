 Hierarchical Organization Structure with SQL Server using Recursive CTE
 
 Introduction:
 Hello everyone! Welcome back to my channel! In today's video, 
 we’re going to learn how to visualize and query a hierarchical employee structure within a SQL Server database. This is particularly useful 
 for businesses and teams that want to easily navigate their reporting structures or visualize managerial relationships.

 Purpose of the Video:
 The purpose of this video is to demonstrate how to organize employees by role in a hierarchical format, showing their reporting lines from top-level management down to interns.
 We’ll walk through the SQL code step-by-step, so you can see how a recursive common table expression (CTE) helps build this hierarchy.

 Problem Statement:
 Imagine a company database where we have information about employees 
 across multiple departments. Each employee has a designated role, like 
 Senior Manager, Manager,Deputy Manager, Employee, or Intern, and reports 
 to someone above them.The challenge is to structure this data to display 
 each employee’s reporting line,giving us a clear view of the 
 entire organization.

 Solution Overview:
 To solve this problem, we’ll use a recursive CTE in SQL Server. 
 This technique allows us to retrieve hierarchical data by repeatedly 
joining a tab to itself, which helps in building relationships between managers  and their subordinates.
Let’s dive into the code and see how this is done.
